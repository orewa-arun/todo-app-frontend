1. How to make API calls?
    * Install axios : 
        ```bash
        npm i axios @types/axios
        ```
    * Axios calls are async, so create a async function for each call as required, include error handling as a rule!. ex : 
        ```typescript
        const getAllTasks = async () => {
            try {
                const response : AxiosResponse = await axios.get(url);
                console.log(response);
            } catch (err) {
                console.log(err);
            }
        }
        ```
    * Then export these functions so that they can be used later.

2. Define the important types:
    * Return types and the types you store in your useState() hooks have to be defined, so define types accordingly. ex :
    ``` typescript
    type Todo = {
        _id: string;
        name: string;
        description: string;
    }
    ``` 

3. How the API call functions to be organised in components?
    * Create async functions in order to make use of API call functions.
    * assign the setters from u seState hooks in those async functions. ex :
    ``` typescript
    const getEverything = async () => {
        // Use the axios function
        const tasks = await getAllTasks();
        setTasks(tasks);
    }
    ```
